SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
===================

Hardware:
  - Windows 7 or newer
  - 2GB+ RAM available
  - Dual-core processor
  - 100MB free disk space

Software:
  - PowerShell 3.0+ (included in Windows)
  - Backend server.exe (must exist)
  - Go runtime (to rebuild if needed)

Network:
  - Port 8080 available (for server)
  - localhost connectivity

WORKFLOW
========

STEP 1: PREPARE
  [ ] Close unnecessary applications
  [ ] Ensure backend/cmd/server/server.exe exists
  [ ] Check port 8080 is available
  [ ] Have 15 minutes available

STEP 2: RUN TEST
  [ ] Double-click QUICK_START.bat
  [ ] Select Option 1 (Full Test)
  [ ] Press any key to start
  [ ] Wait 2+ minutes for test to complete

STEP 3: REVIEW RESULTS
  [ ] Check console output for summary
  [ ] Look for any CRITICAL alerts
  [ ] Note the key metrics (peak CPU, peak memory)

STEP 4: ANALYZE CSV
  [ ] Open monitoring_results.csv in Excel
  [ ] Create line charts for CPU and memory trends
  [ ] Check for memory growth patterns
  [ ] Identify any anomalies

STEP 5: DOCUMENT
  [ ] Fill out TEST_REPORT_TEMPLATE.txt
  [ ] Save results with date/time
  [ ] Document any issues found
  [ ] Plan optimization if needed

STEP 6: OPTIMIZE (IF NEEDED)
  [ ] Address memory leaks or high CPU
  [ ] Review backend code
  [ ] Rebuild and retest
  [ ] Compare before/after metrics

EXPECTED RESULTS
================

For a healthy system:
  ✓ Peak CPU:              20-50%
  ✓ Average CPU:           5-15%
  ✓ Peak Memory:           100-300MB
  ✓ Memory Growth:         < 20MB over 2 minutes
  ✓ Memory Plateau:        Yes (stabilizes after ~30 seconds)
  ✓ Thread Count:          Stable (not constantly increasing)
  ✓ System Responsiveness: Normal (no freezes)
  ✓ No CRITICAL alerts

If you see these, there may be issues:
  ✗ Peak CPU > 80%
  ✗ Peak Memory > 1500MB
  ✗ Memory growth > 50MB/minute
  ✗ Threads continuously increasing
  ✗ CRITICAL alerts in report
  ✗ System becomes unresponsive

COMMON ISSUES & QUICK FIXES
=============================

Issue: "Cannot reach server at localhost:8080"
Fix:   - Check server.exe exists at backend\cmd\server\
       - Verify port 8080 is not in use
       - Check Windows Firewall isn't blocking

Issue: "High memory usage detected"
Fix:   - This might be normal for streaming
       - Check if memory stabilizes (plateaus)
       - If memory keeps growing, investigate for leak

Issue: "High CPU usage"
Fix:   - Normal under load
       - If sustained > 80%, code may need optimization
       - Try lower request rates in load test

Issue: "Script won't run"
Fix:   - Run: powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
       - Verify all files in same directory
       - Check server.exe exists
