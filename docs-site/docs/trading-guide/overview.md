## Trading Basics

### Understanding Markets

Financial markets allow buying and selling of instruments:

- **Forex**: Currency pairs (EUR/USD, GBP/JPY)
- **Crypto**: Digital currencies (BTC/USD, ETH/USD)
- **Commodities**: Gold, Oil, Agricultural products
- **Indices**: Stock market indices (S&P 500, Nasdaq)
- **Stocks**: Company shares

### Key Concepts

#### Bid and Ask Price
- **Bid**: Price at which you can SELL
- **Ask**: Price at which you can BUY
- **Spread**: Difference between bid and ask

```
Example:
EUR/USD Bid: 1.0849
EUR/USD Ask: 1.0851
Spread: 0.0002 (2 pips)
```

#### Lots and Position Sizing
- **Standard Lot**: 100,000 units
- **Mini Lot**: 10,000 units
- **Micro Lot**: 1,000 units

```
Example trade:
0.1 lots EUR/USD = 10,000 EUR
1 pip movement = $1 profit/loss
```

#### Leverage
- Amplifies your buying power
- Example: 1:100 leverage
  - $1,000 deposit controls $100,000 position
  - Higher leverage = Higher risk

:::warning Leverage Risk
While leverage can amplify profits, it also amplifies losses. Use leverage carefully and always use stop-loss orders.

## Order Types

### Market Order
- Executes immediately at current price
- Guaranteed fill
- May experience slippage

### Limit Order
- Executes only at specified price or better
- No guarantee of fill
- No slippage

### Stop Order
- Becomes market order when price reached
- Used to enter positions or protect profits
- May experience slippage

### Stop-Limit Order
- Becomes limit order when stop price reached
- More control but may not fill
- Useful in volatile markets

See [Order Types](/docs/trading-guide/orders/order-types) for detailed explanations.

## Risk Management Essentials

### The 1% Rule
Never risk more than 1-2% of your account on a single trade.

```
Example:
Account Balance: $10,000
Maximum Risk per Trade: $100-200
If stop loss is 50 pips, position size = $2 per pip
```

### Position Sizing Formula

```
Position Size = Risk Amount / (Stop Loss in pips × Pip Value)
```

### Stop-Loss Guidelines

1. **Always use stop-loss orders**
2. Set before entering trade
3. Based on technical levels, not arbitrary
4. Don't move stop-loss against your position

See [Risk Management](/docs/trading-guide/risk/overview) for comprehensive strategies.
