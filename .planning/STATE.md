# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-15)

**Core value:** Brokers can launch and operate a complete trading business rivaling MT5 in capability, with professional client trading tools and comprehensive broker management systems.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 — Database Migration (Phase 1 complete)

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 15 (Database Migration)
Plan: 2 of 4 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-01-16 — Completed 02-02-PLAN.md (Repository Implementation)

Progress: ▓░░░░░░░░░ 6.7% (1/15 phases, 5/19 plans total)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 5
- Average duration: ~1.3 hours per plan
- Total execution time: 1 day (2026-01-16)

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Security & Configuration | 3/3 | 1 day | ~8 hours |
| 2. Database Migration | 2/4 | ~40 min | ~20 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 3 plans: Phase 1 complete (3/3), Phase 2 in progress (2/4)
- Trend: Accelerating with autonomous task execution

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 02-01 | Used pgx v5 directly instead of database/sql | 30-50% performance improvement for PostgreSQL-specific operations |
| 02-01 | Connection pool: 20 max, 5 min connections | Optimized for trading platform based on (CPU cores * 2) + 1 baseline |
| 02-01 | DECIMAL for financial values, TIMESTAMPTZ for timestamps | Production-grade financial data handling with timezone awareness |
| 02-01 | Singleton pattern for connection pool | Application-wide pool reuse, initialized once at startup |
| 02-02 | Use REPEATABLE READ isolation for financial operations | Ensures consistency for balance updates and position closing per PostgreSQL best practices |
| 02-02 | Repository pattern with dependency injection | Enables testability and separates data access from business logic |
| 02-02 | Trades are immutable (no update methods) | Execution records should never be modified after creation |
| 02-02 | Pagination for trade queries | Large trading histories need efficient querying with limit/offset |

## Phase 1 Completion Summary

**Phase 1: Security & Configuration** ✅ Complete (2026-01-16)

All 3 plans executed successfully:
1. ✅ Environment Configuration & Secret Management (01-environment-secrets)
2. ✅ WebSocket Security & CORS Validation (02-websocket-cors)
3. ✅ Password Security Hardening (03-password-security)

**Success Criteria Verification:**
- ✅ No hardcoded credentials exist in codebase
- ✅ JWT tokens use cryptographically secure secret (44-byte)
- ✅ WebSocket connections validate origin against whitelist
- ✅ All passwords stored as bcrypt hashes (no plaintext fallback)
- ✅ Platform starts successfully using .env configuration

**Key Achievements:**
- Eliminated all hardcoded credentials (OANDA API keys, JWT secrets)
- Implemented production-grade CORS validation with wildcard support
- Enforced bcrypt-only password authentication
- Created comprehensive environment configuration system
- Added security logging and fail-safe behaviors

**Ready for:** Phase 2 - Database Migration
