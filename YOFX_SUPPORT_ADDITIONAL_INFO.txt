2. Is there a specific tag order or additional tags required for your server?
3. Should we use a different SubscriptionRequestType (263) value?
4. Do we need to send SecurityListRequest (35=x) first before MarketDataRequest?
5. Can you provide a working example MarketDataRequest for YOFX2 account?
6. Is the market data feed active/operational on your end?
